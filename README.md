This script MUST BE RUN on anISearch's list view for its indexes, otherwise it will not work (URL must include view=2). It will extract the title from each entry, iterating through all the pages of the index. It is compatible with filters and it will work mostly for comparing different regional catalogs on streaming platforms.

You may feel free to modify this script as you see fit, or contact me if you would like for this script to have any specific feature you might need. As this was made specifically for my needs, it won't do much more than what's been explained.
